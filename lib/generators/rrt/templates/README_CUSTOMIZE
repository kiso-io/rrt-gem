You're ready to customize your theme!

The theme can now be fully customized in:

  app/assets/stylesheets/rrt.css.scss

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  * Ensure `gem 'sass-rails'` has been added to your Gemfile, and is
    not in the `assets` group.

  * Port any changes you made to rrt.css.scss. Remove
    app/assets/stylesheets/rrt.css.

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/rrt.css.scss is loaded in
    application.css with `require rrt`.

    NOTE: There must NOT be a `require_tree .` in the application.css,
    as this can load things in a random order, and you may get errors
    about variables not being defined.

  * Lastly, restart your server if it's already running.

We really appreciate your business here at Dresssed, thanks for buying!
