You're ready to customize your theme!

The theme can now be fully customized in:

  app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.scss

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  * Ensure `gem 'sass-rails'` has been added to your Gemfile, and is
    not in the `assets` group.

  * Port any changes you made to dresssed.css.scss. Remove
    app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.scss is loaded in
    application.css with `require_tree .` or `require dresssed`.

  * Lastly, restart your server if it's already running.

We really appreciate your business here at Kantan, thanks for buying!
