Thanks for supporting our mom & pop software company running from the middle
of nowhere! We really appreciate it.

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  * Choose a theme style in app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css is loaded in application.css
    with `require_tree .` or `require dresssed`.

  * Ensure `require dresssed` has been added to
    app/assets/javascripts/application.js.

  * Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
    For example:

      root :to => "home#index"

  * If you are deploying on Heroku, you may want to set:

      config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

    On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
    or load models when precompiling your assets.

  * If you are using simple_form, don't forget to run:

      rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap

  * Browse the theme documentation:

      Rails Integration: https://dresssed-ives-demo.herokuapp.com/preview/004_rails_integration@fa-diamond%2F001_overview_fullpage

  * Lastly, restart your server if it's already running.

<% if can_customize? %>
If you want to fully customize your theme (edit SCSS variables and be picky
about what is being put in your CSS), run `rails generate dresssed:customize`.
If you just want to change the logo, see app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.
<% end %>

We really appreciate your business here at Kantan, thanks for buying!
